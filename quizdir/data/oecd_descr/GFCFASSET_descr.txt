Asset types in this indicator include six groups: dwellings (excluding land); other buildings and structures (roads, bridges, airfields, dams, etc.); transport equipment (ships, trains, aircraft, etc.); other machinery and equipment (ICT equipment, office machinery and hardware, as well as weapons systems etc.); cultivated assets (managed forests, livestock raised for milk production, etc.) and intellectual property products (intangible fixed assets such as R&amp;D, mineral exploration, software and databases, and literary and artistic originals, etc.). "Dwellings" includes "Other buildings and structures" for Chile, Norway, Portugal and Turkey. It also includes "Cultivated assets" for Chile. "Cultivated assets" are not capitalised for Canada and the United States. "Transport equipment" is included in "Other machinery and equipment" for Australia, Chile and Turkey. "Ownership transfer costs" are included in the total assets but not in the breakdown for Australia and South Africa. The United Kingdom has improved its valuation of artistic originals, based on the sum of costs approach. Australia includes weapons systems in "Other machinery and equipment", the United States includes them in "Transport equipment" (missiles, tanks, etc.) and "Other machinery equipment" (electronic and other equipment). This indicator is measured as percentage of total gross fixed capital formation. Main assets are measured as a percentage of total gross fixed capital formation. Data are under 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) for all countries except Chile, Japan and Turkey (SNA 1993).
