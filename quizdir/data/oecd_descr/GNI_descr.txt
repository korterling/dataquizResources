Gross national income (GNI) is defined as gross domestic product, plus net receipts from abroad of wages and salaries and of property income, plus net taxes and subsidies receivable from abroad. Net national income (NNI) is equal to GNI net of depreciation. Wages and salaries from abroad are those that are earned by residents who essentially live and consume inside the economic territory but work abroad (this happens in border areas on a regular basis) or for people who live and work abroad for only short periods (seasonal workers) and whose centre of economic interest remains in their home country. Guest-workers and other migrant workers who live abroad for twelve months or more are considered to be resident in the country where they are working. Such workers may send part of their earnings to relatives at home, but these remittances are treated as transfers between resident and non-resident households and are recorded in national disposable income but not in national income. Property income from/to abroad includes interest, dividends and all or part of the retained earnings of foreign enterprises owned fully or in part by residents (and vice versa). This indicator is measured in USD per capita and in million USD at current prices and PPPs. Data are under 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) for all countries except Chile, Japan and Turkey (SNA 1993).
