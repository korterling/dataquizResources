Value-added in financial corporations presents the share between labour and capital of value added and the change in the shares between selected time periods. The indicator is presented net of depreciation because depreciation is a cost of production – that is, it reflects the amount that needs to be set aside to replace fixed assets as they are used up in the production process. As such, this indicator provides a better picture of the returns to capital needed to maintain the same level of production in the future. This indicator is measured in percentage of net value added. The financial corporation sector includes all private and public entities engaged in financial activities such as monetary institutions (including central banks), financial intermediaries, insurance companies and pension funds. The indicator is calculated by dividing compensation of employees and operating surplus by the net value added of the financial sector. Data are under 2008 System of National Accounts (SNA 2008) for all countries except for Chile, Japan and Turkey (SNA 1993).
